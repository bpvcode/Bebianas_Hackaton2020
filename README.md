# Give a wish ðŸ§ž

**This is our first Hackathon.**

With the Christina Aguilera song "Genie in a Bottle" as a theme to create a web app in 24h hours, with a 5 members team, our project was about finding a funny way to exchange gifts in festive seasons (like secret santa) and also making the user donate a percentage of the bought gift to a ONG's.

This was only an MVP to present.

**NOTE:** Project in master branch
